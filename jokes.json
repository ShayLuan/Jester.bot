As it turned out, she barely said good morning, let alone \"Happy Birthday.\"   I thought... Well, that's marriage for you, but the kids... They will remember.  My kids came bounding down stairs to breakfast and didn't say a word. So when I left for the office, I felt pretty low and somewhat despondent.   As I walked into my office, my secretary Jane said,  \"Good Morning Boss, and by the way Happy Birthday!\"  It felt a little better that at least someone had remembered. I worked until one o'clock, when Jane knocked on my door and said, \"You know, It's such a beautiful day outside, and it is your Birthday, what do you say we go out to lunch, just you and me.\"   I said, \"Thanks, Jane, that's the greatest thing I've heard all day. Let's go!\"  We went to lunch. But we didn't go where we normally would go.   She chose instead a quiet bistro with a private table.  We had two Martinis each and I enjoyed the meal tremendously.  On the way back to the office, Jane said, \"You know, It's such a beautiful day... We don't need to go straight back to the office, do we?\"   I responded, \"I guess not. What do you have in mind?\"  She said, \"Let's drop by my apartment, it's just around the corner.\"  After arriving at her apartment, Jane turned to me and said,  \"Boss, if you don't mind, I'm going to step into the bedroom for just a moment. I'll be right back.\"  \"Okay,\" I nervously replied. She went into the bedroom and, after a couple of minutes, she came out carrying a huge birthday cake.

After paying  $500,000, he takes it out for a spin and stops at a red light. While waiting for the light to change, an frail looking old man on a yellow moped pulls up next to him. The old man looks over at the Ferrari and asks, \"What kind of car ya' got there, Sonny?\"   The young man replies, \"A Ferrari GTO. It cost half a million dollars!\"   \"Wheeewee... that's a lot of money,\" says the old man as he tucks his thumbs up against his suspenders. \"Why does it cost so much?\"   \"Because this car can do up to 320 miles an hour!\" states the banker proudly.   The moped driver asks, \"Mind if I take a look inside?\"   \"No problem,\" replies the proud new owner. So the old man pokes his head in the window and looks around at all the bells and whistles lining the dashboard. Sitting back on his moped, the old man whistles and says, \"That's a pretty nice car, all right... but I'll stick with my moped!\"   Just then the light changes, so the banker decides to show the old man just what his car can do. He floors it, and within 30 seconds, the speedometer reads 160 mph! Suddenly, he notices a yellow dot in his rear view mirror. It seems to be getting closer! He slows down to see what it could be, and suddenly... Whoooooosssshhhhh! Something blows by him, going much faster!   \"What in the hell could be going faster than my Ferrari?\" the young man asks himself. He floors the accelerator and takes the Ferrari up to 250 mph. Then, up ahead of him, he sees that it's the old man on the moped! Amazed that the moped could pass his Ferrari, he gives it more gas and passes the moped at 275 mph. Whoooooosssshhhhh!   He's feeling pretty good until he looks in his mirror and sees the old man gaining on him again! Dumbfounded, the banker floors the gas pedal and takes the Ferrari all the way up to 320 mph. Not ten seconds later, he sees the moped bearing down on him again!   The Ferrari red lines and there's nothing more he can do! Suddenly, the moped plows into the back of his Ferrari, demolishing the rear end. The young man stops and jumps out, and unbelievably, the old man is still alive. He runs up to the mangled old man and says, \"Oh my God! Is there anything I can do for you?\" The old man whispers with his dying breath... \"Unhook... my... suspenders... from... your.... side view mirror.\"",

The sheriff figures even a short stay in jail will be plenty after a little “justice” from the townspeople.  The sheriff takes the criminals to the town square, handcuffs them posts and sets up shop. He tells the people that the punishment should fit the crime so anyone can pay $1 to kick the rapist in the groin. Since the con artist used his image to wrong his victims, anyone can pay $1 to hit him in the face.  After a while there are two long lines for the criminals. Some people paying $5, $10, even $15 to get their licks in. After a long while, a guy steps up for his turn and sees the con artist’s face is a bloody pulp and thinks “He’s so beat up at this point, he probably can’t even feel anything anymore. I’m not going to waste my money on that.” So the guy walks up and kicks the con artist squarely in the groin.

None of the apartments in this complex have air-conditioning. It's close to midnight, December in Sydney AUS, it's a hot humid night.   **Story:** With the heat and humidity I was finding it very hard to sleep, and had taken to watching some Japanese horror flicks on my laptop to kill some time. I had my headphones on since I needed to open all the bedroom windows (thanks to the heat) and I didn't want to disturb my neighbours. At a poignant part of the story in the movie, I could hear over the sound track a slow rhythmic masculine groan. After about a minute of confusion I realised that some of my neighbours were enjoying some casual coital union. The rhythmic groan picked up in frequency and amplitude, and was soon offset with his partners feminine \"yes\"es. Needless to say, I was no longer watching my horror movie and I was laughing hysterically, yet quietly, at this point into my pillow.  Quickly their coital activities got to a point of \"fever pitch\" where the male neighbour announced, \"I'm gonna cum, I'm gonna cum!\" to which the female neighbour demands he \"wait, and cum on my face!\". Cue a series of climatic groaning and other such sounds of affirmation.  Job done, the female announces that she's heading off to have a shower (good call) and goes to the bathroom to do so. All the windows are open it seems, as one can hear all the associated sounds of a shower hard earned.   Upon her arrival back into the bedroom the female scolds her counterpart for lighting up and enjoying a cigarette in her absence,  stating \"Dammit you know that ciggie smoke irritates my sinuses!\". Shortly after this statement, she sneezes loudly and impressively. At this point I turn towards my open window and say in a nice loud voice \"Bless you!\"...  ..Silence...  ...An embarrassed scream.  ...And a Guinness World Record attempt in the number of windows closed in the shortest period of time possible.

John, their leader, a big burly man of 53, gets off his Harley, walks through a group of gawkers, past the State Trooper who was trying to talk her down off the railing, and says, \"Hey Baby . . . whatcha doin' up there on that railin'?\" She says tearfully, \"I'm going to kill myself!!\" While he didn't want to appear \"sensitive,\" John also didn't want to miss this \"be-a-legend\" opportunity either so he asked, \"Well, before you jump, Honey-Babe . . . why don't you give ol' John here your best last kiss?\" So, with no hesitation at all, she leaned back over the railing and did just that . . . and it was a long, deep, lingering kiss followed immediately by another even better one. After they breathlessly finished, John gets a big thumbs-up approval from his biker-buddies, the onlookers, and even the State Trooper, and then says, \"Wow! That was the best kiss I have ever had! That's a real talent you're wasting there, Sugar Shorts. You could be famous if you rode with me. Why are you committing suicide?\" She explained, \"My parents don't like me dressing up like a girl.\" It's still unclear whether she jumped or was pushed.

He took out a business card, wrote 'Revelation 3:20' on the back of it and stuck it in the door.  When the offering was processed the following Sunday, he found that his card had been returned. Added to it was this cryptic message, 'Genesis 3:10..'  Reaching for his Bible to check out the citation, he broke up in gales of laughter.  Revelation 3:20 begins 'Behold, I stand at the door and knock.'  Genesis 3:10 reads, 'I heard your voice in the garden and I was afraid for I was naked.'",

Two months passed and the couple are still waiting.    While waiting, they began to wonder what would happen if it didn't work out;  could you get a divorce in heaven.

The auditor said, ‘Well, sir, you have an extravagant lifestyle and no full-time employment, which you explain by saying that you win money gambling. I’m not sure the IRS finds that believable.’  ‘I’m a great gambler, and I can prove it,’ says Grandpa. ‘How about a demonstration?’  The auditor thinks for a moment and says, ‘Okay. Go ahead. ‘  Grandpa says, ‘I’ll bet you a thousand dollars that I can bite my own eye.’  The auditor thinks a moment and says, ‘It’s a bet.’  Grandpa removes his glass eye and bites it. The auditor’s jaw drops.  Grandpa says, ‘Now, I’ll bet you two thousand dollars that I can bite my other eye.’  The auditor can tell Grandpa isn’t blind, so he takes the bet.  Grandpa removes his dentures and bites his good eye. The stunned auditor now realizes he has wagered and lost three grand, with Grandpa’s attorney as a witness. He starts to get nervous.  ‘Want to go double or nothing?’ Grandpa asks ‘I’ll bet you six thousand dollars that I can stand on one side of your desk, and pee into that wastebasket on the other side, and never get a drop anywhere in between.’  The auditor, twice burned, is cautious now, but he looks carefully and decides there’s no way this old guy could possibly manage that stunt, so he agrees again.  Grandpa stands beside the desk and unzips his pants, but although he strains mightily, he can’t make the stream reach the wastebasket on the other side, so he pretty much urinates all over the auditor’s desk.  The auditor leaps with joy, realizing that he has just turned a major loss into a huge win.   But Grandpa’s own attorney moans and puts his head in his hands.  ‘Are you okay?’ the auditor asks.   ‘Not really,’ says the attorney. ‘This morning, when Grandpa told me he’d been summoned for an audit, he bet me twenty-five thousand dollars that he could come in here and pee all over your desk and that you’d be happy about it.’",

He loved his job, driving a train had been his dream ever since he was a child.   He loved to make the train go as fast as possible.   Unfortunately, one day he was a little too reckless and caused a crash.   He made it out, but a single person died.   Well, needless to say, he went to court over this incident.   He was found guilty, and was sentenced to death by electrocution.   When the day of the execution came, he requested a single banana as his last meal.   After eating the banana, he was strapped into the electric chair.   The switch was flown, sparks flew and smoke filled the air- but nothing happened.  The man was perfectly fine.  Well, at the time, there was an old Bulgarian law that said a failed execution was a sign of divine intervention, so the man was allowed to go free.   And somehow, he managed to get his old job back driving the train.   Having not learned his lesson at all, he went right back to driving the train with reckless abandon.   Once again, he caused a train to crash, this time killing two people.   The trial went much the same as the first, resulting in a sentence of execution.   For his final meal, the man requested two bananas.   After eating the bananas, he was strapped into the electric chair.  The switch was thrown, sparks flew, smoke filled the room- and the man was once again unharmed.  Well, this of course meant that he was free to go.   And once again, he somehow manages to get his old job back.   To what should have been the surprise of no one, he crashed yet another train and killed three people.   And so he once again found himself being sentenced to death.   On the day of his execution, he requested his final meal- three bananas.  \"You know what? No,\" said the executioner. \"I've had it with you and your stupid bananas and walking out of here unharmed. I'm not giving you a thing to eat, we're strapping you in and doing this now.\"   Well, it was against protocol, but the man was strapped in to the electric chair without a last meal.   The switch was pulled, sparks flew, smoke filled the room- and the man was still unharmed.   The executioner was speechless.

Then the guy asks Bob to point it for him, and Bob points for him. Bob then shakes it, puts it back in and zips it up.

They get back to his place, and as he shows her around his apartment, she notices that one wall of his bedroom is completely filled with soft, sweet, cuddly teddy bears.   There are three shelves in the bedroom, with hundreds and hundreds of cute, cuddly teddy bears carefully placed in rows, covering the entire wall!   It was obvious that he had taken quite some time to lovingly arrange them and she was immediately touched by the amount of thought he had put into organizing the display.   There were small bears all along the bottom shelf, medium-sized bears covering the length of the middle shelf, and huge, enormous bears running all the way along the top shelf.   She found it strange for an obviously masculine guy to have such a large collection of teddy bears.  She is quite impressed by his sensitive side, but doesn't mention this to him.    They share a bottle of wine and continue talking and,   After awhile, she finds herself thinking,    'Oh my God! Maybe, this guy could be the one!   'Maybe he could be the future father of my children?'    She turns to him and kisses him lightly on the lips.   He responds warmly.   They continue to kiss, the passion builds.   And he romantically lifts her in his arms and carries her into his bedroom,  where they rip off each other's clothes and make hot, steamy love.  She is so overwhelmed that she responds with more passion, more creativity, more heat than she has ever known.  After an intense, explosive night of raw passion with this sensitive guy,  they are lying there together in the afterglow. The woman rolls over, gently strokes his chest and asks coyly,   'Well, how was it?'   The guy gently smiles at her,  strokes her cheek,  looks deeply into her eyes,        and says:     'Help yourself to any prize from the middle shelf.'",

The only friction in their marriage was the husband's habit of farting loudly every morning when he awoke.  The noise would wake his wife and the smell would make her eyes water and make her gasp for air.  Every morning she would plead with him to stop ripping them off because it was making her sick. He told her he couldn't stop and that it was perfectly natural. She told him to see a doctor. She was concerned that one day he would blow his guts out.  The years went by and he continued to rip them out! Then one Thanksgiving morning as she was preparing the turkey for dinner and he was upstairs sound asleep, she looked at the bowl where she had put the turkey innards and neck, gizzard, liver and all the spare parts and a malicious thought came to her.  She took the bowl and went upstairs where her husband was sound asleep and, gently pulling back the bed covers, she pulled back the elastic waistband of his underpants and emptied the bowl of turkey guts into his shorts.  Some time later she heard her husband waken with his usual trumpeting which was followed by a blood curdling scream and the sound of frantic footsteps as he ran into the bathroom.  The wife could hardly control herself as she rolled on the floor laughing, tears in her eyes! After years of torture she reckoned she had got him back pretty good.  About twenty minutes later, her husband came downstairs in his bloodstained underpants with a look of horror on his face.  She bit her lip as she asked him what was the matter. He said, \"Honey, you were right. All these years you have warned me and I didn't listen to you.  \"What do you mean?\" asked his wife.  \"Well, you always told me that one day I would end up farting my guts out, and today it finally happened.

After some hesitation, the staff escorted the elderly woman to the president's office. The president asked how much money she wished to deposit in the bank.  '$165,000' she answered, and poured the bank notes from her bag on the table.  Obviously, the president got really curious about the origin of all this money, so he asked where the cash came from.  'Gambling' she muttered.  'What kind of gambling?' the president asked.  'Bets. Let me give you a real example. I'll bet you $25,000 that your balls are rectangular.'  'Hahaha. That's a stupid bet. You could never win.'  'Would you care to accept the bet, then?' asked the elderly woman in a challenging tone.  'Of course! I'll bet $25,000 that my balls aren't rectangular!'  'Since it's such a large sum, would it be possible for me to return tomorrow morning with my attorney as our witness?'  'Sure' said the president of the bank in an extremely satisfied tone.  That night, the president actually got scared because of the bet. He spent quite some time in front of the mirror, checking his balls, turning them to the left, to the right, and to the left again. He meticulously inspected them to make 100% sure his balls weren't rectangular so he could win the bet.  The next morning, the elderly woman entered the president's office with her lawyer. She introduced the latter to the president and repeated the bet.  'So $25,000 that the president's balls are rectangular!'  The president accepted the bet once again, then the little old woman asked him to lower his pants so they could all see his balls. The president complied. The elderly woman inspected his balls really closely, then inquired whether she could touch them, which the president accepted... after all, he had the opportunity to win $25,000!  That's when he noticed the woman's lawyer started to bang his head against the wall.  'What's the problem with your attorney, m'am?'  'Oh, nothing.

Mick, the bartender, says \"You'll not be drinking any more tonight, Paddy\" Paddy replies \"OK Mick, I'll be on me way then.\" Paddy spins around on his stool and steps off. He falls flat on his face. \"Shoite\" he says and pulls himself up by the stool and dusts himself off. He takes a step towards the door and falls flat on his face. \"Shoite, Shoite!\" He looks to the doorway and thinks to himself that if he can just get to the door and some fresh air he'll be fine. He belly crawls to the door and shimmies up to the door frame. He sticks his head outside and takes a deep breath of fresh air, feels much better and takes a step out onto the sidewalk. He falls flat on his face. \"Bi'Jesus... I'm tanked,\" he says. He can see his house just a few doors down, and crawls to the door and shimmies up the door frame, opens the door and shimmies inside. He takes a look up the stairs and says \"No way!\" He crawls up the stairs to his bedroom door and says \"If i can just make it to me bed.\" He takes a step into the room and falls flat on his face. He says \"to hell with it\" and falls into bed. The next morning, his wife, Jess, comes into the room carrying a cup of coffee and says, \"Get up Paddy. Did you have a bit to drink last night?\". Paddy says, \"I did Jess. I was tanked' pissed. But how'd you know?\" \"Mick called. You left y'wheelchair at the pub.\"",

        "joke": "A politician dies... And ends up standing in front of the pearly gates. Saint Peter looks at him for a second, flicks through his book, and finds his name.  \"So, you're a politician...\" \"Well, yes, is that a problem?\" \"Oh no, no problem. But we've recently adopted a new system for people in your line of work, and unfortunately you will have to spend a day in Hell. After that however, you're free to choose where you want to spend eternity!\"  \"Wait, I have to spend a day in Hell??\" says the politician. \"Them's the rules\" Says St Peter, clicks his fingers, and WOOMPH, the guy dissapears... And awakes, curled up with his hands over his eyes, knowing he's in Hell. Cautiously, he listens for the screams, sniffs the air for brimstone, and finds... Nothing. Just the smell of, is that fabric softener? And cut grass, this can't be right?  \"Open your eyes!\" says a voice. \"C'mon, wakey wakey, we've only got 24 hours!\". Nervously, he uncovers his eyes, looks around, and sees he's in a hotel room. A nice one too. Wait, this is a penthouse suite... And there's a smiling man in a suit, holding a martini. \"Who are you??\" The politician asks. \"Well, I'm Satan!\" says the man, handing him the drink and helping him to his feet. \"Welcome to Hell!\" \"Wait, this is Hell? But... Where's all the pain and suffering?\" he asks. Satan throws him a wink. \"Oh, we've been a bit mis-represented over the years, it's a long story. Anyway, this is your room! The minibar is of course free, as is the room service, there's extra towels next to the hot-tub, and if you need anything, just call reception. But enough of this! It's a beautiful day, and if you'd care to look outside...\" Slightly stunned by the opulent surroundings, the man wanders over to the floor-to-ceiling windows through which the sun is glowing, looks far down, and sees a group of people cheering and waving at him from a golf course. \"It's one of 5 pro-level courses on site, and there's another 6 just a few minutes drive out past the beach and harbour!\" says Satan, answering his unasked question. So they head down in the lift, walk out through the glittering lobby where everyone waves and welcomes the man, as Satan signs autographs and cherrily talks shop with the laughing staff. And as he walks out, he sees the group on the golf course are made up of every one of his old friends, people he's admired for years but never met or worked with, and people whose work he's admired but died long before his career started. And out of the middle of this group walks his wife, with a massive smile and the body she had when she was 20, who throws her arms around him and plants a delicate kiss on his cheek. Everyone cheers and applauds, and as they slap him on the back and trade jokes, his worst enemy arrives, as a 2 foot tall goblin-esque caddy. He spends the day in the bright sunshine on the course, having the time of his life laughing at jokes and carrying important discussions, putting the world to rights with his friends while holding his delighted wife next to him as she gazes lovingly at him. Later, they return to the hotel for dinner and have an enormous meal, perfectly cooked, which descends into a food-fight when someone accidentally throws a bread roll at the next table (where Ghandi is having a game of truth-or-dare with Marylin Monroe). As everyone is falling about laughing and flinging breadsticks at each other, his wife whispers in his ear... And they return to their penthouse suite, and spend the rest of the night making love like they did on their honeymoon. After 6 hours of intense passion, the man falls deep into the 100% Egyptian cotton pillows, and falls into a deep and happy sleep... And is woken up by St Peter. \"So, that was Hell. Wasn't what you were expecting, I bet?\" \"No sir!\" says the man. \"So then\" says St Peter \"you can make your choice. It's Hell, which you saw, or Heaven, which has choral singing, talking to God, white robes, and so on\". \"Well... I know this sounds strange, but on balance, I think I'd prefer Hell\" says the politician. \"Not a problem, we totally understand! Enjoy!\" Says St Peter, and clicks his fingers again.  The man wakes up in total darkness, the stench of ammonia filling the air and distant screams the only noise. As he adjusts, he can see the only light is from belches of flame far away, illuminating the ragged remains of people being tortured or burning in a sulphurous ocean. A sudden bolt of lightning reveals Satan next to him, wearing the same suit as before and grinning, holding a soldering iron in one hand and a coil of razor-wire in the other. \"What's this??\" He cries. \"Where's the hotel?? Where's my wife??? Where's the minibar, the golf-courses, the pool, the restaurant, the free drinks and the sunshine???\"  \"Ah\", says Satan. \"You see, yesterday, we were campaigning. But today, you voted...\"",

A leading local politician and member of the congregation was chosen to make the presentation and to give a little speech at the  dinner. However, he was delayed, so the Priest decided to say his own few words while they waited: Thank Goodness we Catholics have a wonderful sense of humour!  “I got my first impression of the parish from the first confession I  heard here. I thought I had been assigned to a terrible place. The  very first person who entered my confessional told me he had stolen a television set and, when questioned by the police, was able to lie his way out of it. He had stolen money from his parents; embezzled from  his employer; had an affair with his boss’s wife; had sex with his  boss’s 17 year old daughter on numerous occasions, taken illegal drugs; had several homosexual affairs; was arrested several times for public nudity and gave VD to his sister in-law.  I was appalled that one person could do so many awful things. But as the days went on, I learned that my people were not all like that and I had, indeed, come to a fine parish full of good and loving people.”  Just as the Priest finished his talk, the politician arrived full of  apologies at being late. He immediately began to make the presentation and gave his talk:  “I’ll never forget the first day our parish Priest arrived,” said the  politician. “In fact, I had the honour of being the first person to go to him for confession.”",

After being persuaded, he drove to the reservation, handed his ticket to the medicine man, and wondered what he was in for.  The medicine man slowly, methodically produced a potion, handed it to him, and with a grip on his shoulder, warned, 'This is powerful medicine. It must be respected. You take only teaspoonful, and then say '1-2-3.' When you do that, you will become manlier than you have ever been in your life, and you can perform as long as you want.\" The old man was encouraged.

When she came in, he took off his clothes and said, \"1-2-3!\"  Immediately, he was the manliest of men. His wife was excited and began throwing off her clothes, and then she asked, \"What was the 1-2-3 for?\"  And that, boys and girls, is why we should never end our sentences with a preposition, because we could end up with a dangling participle.",

Upon hearing that the priest has a few hours off the fisherman invites him out to sea to fish with him.  Out at sea it doesn't take long for the fisherman to realize that the priest has no idea how to fish, so he gives him some quick instruction and shows him how to cast his bait out into the water. Within moments the priest manages to reel in the largest fish that the fisherman has ever seen. In the moment of excitement the fisherman exclaims, \"Look at the size of that Son-of-a-bitch!\"  Immediately the priest becomes disturbed and says, \"My son, please don't use such language.\"  The fisherman, embarrassed and hoping word of this gaffe will not reach the rest of his family, makes up an explanation in a moment of ingenuity, \"Oh no father, that's the name of that type of fish, a son-of-a-bitch.\" He lies, taking advantage of the priests fishing naivete.   The priest is pacified, and begs forgiveness for jumping to conclusions. The fisherman, relieved, brings the priest back to the docks and drops him off.  The priest lumbers back to the church, with the giant fish in his arms. Upon entering the church he sees the bishop and approaches him, \"Bishop, look at the size of this son-of-a-bitch I caught!\"  The bishop stands wide-eyed a moment, \"Priest, how could a man as holy as you use such language in the house of God?\"  The priest calmly explains that it is the name of the fish, and the bishop feeling embarrassed for jumping to conclusions offers to take and clean the fish for the priest.   After cleaning the fish the bishop takes it to the maid in the kitchen and tells her, \"Maid, I want you to cook this son-of-a-bitch for me.\"  The maid blushes and responds, \"Bishop, it may not be my place to say so, but is such language fitting for a man of your stature?\"  The bishop laughs haughtily, explains that it's the name of the fish and that he too had made the same mistake only minutes earlier. The maid laughs too, apologizes and cooks the fish.  It just so happens that the Pope decided to stop in for dinner at their church that evening. They are all sitting at the table when the pope says, \"Oh, my children, I know that gluttony is a sin but I simply can't stop myself from eating this fish. I must know, where did you get it?\"  \"I caught the son-of-a-bitch.\" Said the priest.  \"I cleaned the son-of-a-bitch.\" Said the bishop.  \"And I cooked the son-of-a-bitch.\" Said the maid.  For a moment the pope sat silently, staring at them all wide-eyed. He then slowly removed his hat, kicked off his sandles, put his hands behind his head, kicked his feet up on the table and said, \"You know what? You mother fuckers are alright!\"",

Obama is about to accept defeat when a visibly drunk man staggers out of an apartment building, singing a Russian folk song. Obama leans out the window and shoots him.   Obama: See Vlad, I saw one person and he was drunk! All Russians are drunks!  Six months later Putin travels to Washington DC and he and Obama are having the same argument about morals and society. Putin suggests they do the same thing they did in Moscow, and he will shoot any drunks that he sees on Washington's streets. Obama let's the Secret Service know to go ahead and make sure there are no drunks anywhere on their route.   The two presidents drive around for 10 minutes, without seeing anyone. Just as they're turning around a huge group of drunks stumbles out of a bar. Putin gets excited, leans out the window and mows them all down. He teases Obama for the rest of the night.   Putin: Barack, you said Russians were worse drunks than Americans. I just killed 20 of them, looks like Russia wins again!   The next morning Vladimir Putin picks up the newspaper and sees the headline: 20 Russian Embassy Workers Slain In Drive-By Shooting.",

Gomer looked at the body and said, “Yup, he's pretty well burnt up. Roll him over.” The mortician rolled him over and Gomer said, “No, it ain't Stanley.”  The mortician asked, “How can you tell?”  Gomer said, “Well, Stanley had two ass-holes.”  “What! He had two ass-holes?” asked the mortician.  “Yup, we never seen 'em, but everybody used to say, there's Stanley with them two ass-holes.”",

On the way there, he tells his driver, that looks a bit like him, \"I'm sick of all these conferences, I always say the same things over and over!\"  The drivers agrees, \"You're right, as your driver, I attended all of them, and even though I don't know anything about science, I could give the conference in your place.\"  \"That's a great idea!\" says Einstein \"Lets switch places then!\"  So they switch clothes and as soon as they arrive, the driver dressed as Einstein, goes on stage and starts giving the usual speech, while the real Einstein, dressed as the car driver, attends it.  But in the crowd, there was one scientist who wanted to impress everyone and thought of a very difficult question to ask Einstein, hoping he wouldn't be able to respond.   So this guy stands up and interrupts the conference by posing his very difficult question.   The whole room goes silent, holding their breath, waiting for the response.  The driver looks at him, dead in the eyes and says : \"Sir, your question is so easy to answer that I'm going to let my driver reply to it for me.\"",
